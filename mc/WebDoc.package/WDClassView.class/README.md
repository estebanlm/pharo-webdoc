I create an html view for a class with the following elements:

- Class comment
- Class inheritence and inheritence diagrams
- Summary of class and instance methods
- Details of class and instance methods

see #renderContentOn: for more details.

	selectedClass		<Behavior>
	searchPanel		<WDSearchPanel>

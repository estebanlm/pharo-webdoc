I am a seaside file library containing the resources (Javascript and CSS) necessary for WebDoc.
I decided to manage everything by myself. Seaside is an utter pain in the ass when it comes to static file serving and decent urls. There is so much freaking auto configuration going on and so little documentation and examples availble that it is not worth the effort to do things the seaside way...
